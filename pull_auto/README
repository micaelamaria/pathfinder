Functions:

ask_continue
Inputs: -
Outputs: No output, but will either continue with the next iteration or exit the program.

Ask user if they wish to continue the simulations with the next iteration or quit.
Will be asked after each iteration after equilibration.

check_if_done
Inputs: -
Outputs: RES (0 for fail, 1 for success)

Function for checking if the best force constant is found. Best force constant means that the difference between the best K and the lower value of K is 5 (or less) and the simulation with the lower K failed. Therefore K_BEST is the smallest K possible that is 
still able to pull/push the desired distance.

cleanup
Inputs: Yes/No interactive user input
Outputs: -

Function for cleaning up unnecessary files. Asks the user if they wish to remove files from earlier unsuccessful simulations. Cleanup is recommended. 

new_K
Inputs: -
Outputs: -

Function for determining an array of new K values. Will check STATUS_ARRAY for successful force constants (K) and produce new array of K's of length 3 or 5. Will update STATUS_ARRAY also. Will find the smallest successful K and calculate 1 new
value of K between the successful K and the K from the previous index in the array. The K's will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5.
Example:
K_ARRAY=(10 20 30)
K=20 and K=30 were successful.
Therefore the new K_ARRAY=(10 15 20), and a simulation for K=15 will be run.

read_config
Inputs: -
Outputs: -

Will read the input.config file and check that files are in correct formats and have correct amount of elements. Config file variables will be used in the script.

run_eq
Inputs: Domain and iteration
Outputs: -

Function for running equilibrations. Input domain means the abbreviation of the pulled/pushed domain e.g. TM for transmembrane domain. Iteration means the current step in the entire pulling of the domain. Both inputs will be used in file naming. 
Function will set up and run a flat-bottom equilibration, and after it's done the function will analyze if the system is equilibrated enough. This will happen by analyzing the rmsd slope. Will run eq again with longer wall time if not successful.

run_pull
Inputs: Iteration, K and domain
Outputs: -
