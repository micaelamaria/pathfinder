Functions:

ask_continue
Inputs: -
Outputs: No output, but will either continue with the next iteration or exit the program.

Ask user if they wish to continue the simulations with the next iteration or quit.
Will be asked after each iteration after equilibration.

check_if_done
Inputs: -
Outputs: RES (0 for fail, 1 for success)

Function for checking if the best force constant is found. Best force constant means that the difference between the best K and the lower value of K is 5 (or less) and the simulation with the lower K failed. Therefore K_BEST is the smallest K possible that is 
still able to pull/push the desired distance.

cleanup
Inputs: Yes/No interactive user input
Outputs: -

Function for cleaning up unnecessary files. Asks the user if they wish to remove files from earlier unsuccessful simulations. Cleanup is recommended.
