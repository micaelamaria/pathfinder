Plan:

Ohjeet:
-import your own modules beforte running, at least gromacs and python
-move all files into mahti

Example folder:
-pathfinder
-sbatch
-config
-toppar
-topol
-step7.gro
-pull_eq.mdp
-pull_TK.mdp
-index

-first run init
python pathfinder.py init
-wait for simulations to finish

-then run contpull
python pathfinder.py contpull 0 'TK' 0
-see what happens
    -There should be warning about using Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling when generating velocities.
        This is fine, and if there are no other warnings, please add the following line to the config file:
        maxwarn = 1
    -if the best K hasnt been found, it will run new pulling sims with different used_Ks
    -if the best K has been found, it will ask if you want to equilibrate the system (recommended)
        -it will run eq and again wait for sim to finish

-if you were running a pulling sim, run contpull again
-if you were running equilibration, run conteq
