PATHFINDER
This is the plan for coding the pathfinder tool.


Scripts/functions:
-each output has own MDAnalysis function
-input reader function
-log reader 


Inputs (config file):
-delta x, for example 1nm
-all of slurm arguments: nodes, tasks, time etc.
-mdp files for pulling and eq
-each has some default values or sends an error if not supplied
-Kmin and Kmax
-reaction coordinate
-pull groups
-which part of system for xtc file (e.g. protein)

Outputs:
-error log
    -if not successful, increase wall time or double K_MAX
-pullx and pullf matplotlib png files
-end structure files in pdb format
-rmsd plot of equilibration
-optional xtc rsync with warning of large size
-tree diagram of simulations which shows the successful route
-movie of concat trajectories

TO DO:
-eq success is determined by rmsd and wall time
-user check for each iteration
-remove functions for 3 Ks, use 5 for each
-function for removing unnecessary files
-bash damon for waiting
-log file
(-comments, README file, testing)
