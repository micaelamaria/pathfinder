PATHFINDER
This is the plan for coding the pathfinder tool.


Inputs (config file):
-delta x, for example 1nm
-all of slurm arguments: nodes, tasks, time etc.
-mdp files for pulling and eq
-each has some default values or sends an error if not supplied
-Kmin and Kmax
-reaction coordinate
-pull groups
-which part of system for xtc file (e.g. protein)

Outputs:
-error log
    -if not successful, increase wall time or double K_MAX
-pullx and pullf matplotlib png files
-end structure files in pdb format
-rmsd plot of equilibration
-optional xtc rsync with warning of large size
-tree diagram of simulations which shows the successful route
-movie of concat trajectories


TO DO:
-make demo
-in grompp, check that the warning can be ignored
-run multiples of each iterations
-folder structure for eq


20.12.
-for some reason the 30 and 30 didnt pull even though previously did
    -multiples of sims need to be done so that prob solves it
-remember to push to github

21.12
-remember to push to github
-prob: used_Ks doesnt contain 30 and 40


TO DO:
-outputs such as plots, etc.
-make a file system with folders and move between them
-rsync files, warning for large files
-documentation
(-comments, README file, testing)


Errors:

Questions:
-is exit 1 best way to end program?
-if the user inputs pdb file, they need to also input info for
pdb2gmx, so wouldnt it just be earier to force the user to convert it 
themself?
