PATHFINDER
This is the plan for coding the pathfinder tool.


Inputs (config file):
-delta x, for example 1nm
-all of slurm arguments: nodes, tasks, time etc.
-mdp files for pulling and eq
-each has some default values or sends an error if not supplied
-Kmin and Kmax
-reaction coordinate
-pull groups
-which part of system for xtc file (e.g. protein)

Outputs:
-error log
    -if not successful, increase wall time or double K_MAX
-pullx and pullf matplotlib png files
-end structure files in pdb format
-rmsd plot of equilibration
-optional xtc rsync with warning of large size
-tree diagram of simulations which shows the successful route
-movie of concat trajectories


TO DO:
-make demo
-run multiples of each iterations
    -maybe array jobs
    -10 grompps also??
    -put numbers 1-10 in the end of file names
    -move files to directories after running
    -how to decide which K is the best?
    -how to check all of the xvg files?
-folder structure for eq
-how to keep track of iterations if multiple domains?
    -use unique iteration numbers even if domain changes
-produce K_array in init from K_max in config


11.1.
-it seems that eq and conteq works
-next iteration1
    -before next iter the gro file needs to change, 
        and json files need to be cleaned up
-does contpull need 'dom'?
-in demo check file locations and mahti directories
-change folder names in github

13.1.
-first part of demo works
-next time run contpull

18.1.
-move files to folders in the beginning of contpull
-copy the best K gro file and others needed to main directory
-maybe make a function for checking that files are in correct folder
and correcting them if not
-next to do the 10 copies of sims
    -array jobs
-next time try contpull for demo

24.1.
Today:
-test array jobs and implement
    -naming for copies and moving them to their own folders?
    -add check config if multiples=false
-test if 'python pathfinder.py ...' command can be shortened
-add midpoint files to demo if someone doesnt want to run sims
-run init again (done)
-prob: status_array not defined in new_K (maybe fixed, test)


27.1.
-run contpull
-test array jobs and implement
    -naming for copies and moving them to their own folders?
    -add check config if multiples=false
    -check if any of the copies was successful
-test if 'python pathfinder.py ...' command can be shortened
-add midpoint files to demo if someone doesnt want to run sims
-new K might not need status_array as argument
-in example folder, 35 running, next run contpull, wrong gro file but ignore
-in example/test/files/ running init, next test contpull


TO DO:
-outputs such as plots, etc.
-make a file system with folders and move between them
-rsync files, warning for large files



Errors:

Questions:
-is exit 1 best way to end program?
-if the user inputs pdb file, they need to also input info for
pdb2gmx, so wouldnt it just be earier to force the user to convert it 
themself?
