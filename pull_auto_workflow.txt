1. Set up pulling sim in cluster and run
    1.1 Set up pull.sh
        1.1.1 In pull.sh, change K in:
                -output 
                -jobname 
                -in mdrun, tpr file name and both xvg file names
        1.1.2 In pull.mdp, change K
        1.1.3 Load gromacs module and run grompp
    1.2 sbatch pull.sh
    1.3 Check that the sim is running
2. Check results
    2.1 Check if finished
    2.2 Check if pulling was successful
        2.2.1 Check log and txt files
    2.3 Check pulling speed and max force
    2.4 Visualize trajectory in vmd
3. Run new simulation
    3.1 Choose new K
    3.2 Repeat step 1
4. Repeat 2 & 3 until optimal value found
    -Optimal K means K-5 not successful but K is successful
